		<Nav ID="0" SubTitle="Pilot-operated hydraulics" SubPic1="1_0_smarthydraulics.jpg" SubPic2="1_0_pilot1.jpg" SubPic3="NA"><![CDATA[<p>Pilot-operated hydraulics and a load-sensing, pressure-compensated system provide optimum flow and power to all hydraulic functions as needed, improving performance.</p><p>This improves operation when more than one function is being used simultaneously and it improves fuel economy. More power also is available to the wheels when hydraulics are not being used.</p>]]></Nav>
		<Nav ID="1" SubTitle="Loader linkage options" SubPic1="1_1_loaderconfig1.jpg" SubPic2="1_1_loaderconfig2.jpg" SubPic3="NA"><![CDATA[<p>The 721D comes in standard Z-bar linkage or a tool-carrier configuration for maximum versatility. These wheel loaders deliver superior breakout forces up to 32,960 pounds (14 950 kg) to move more material per hour.</p>]]></Nav>
		<Nav ID="2" SubTitle="Larger buckets fill faster" SubPic1="1_2_01106.JPG" SubPic2="1_2_Image01.jpg" SubPic3="1_2_bucketfill.jpg"><![CDATA[<p>Bucket capacities on the 721D have been increased to between 3.0 and 3.5 cubic yards (2.30 to 2.70 cubic meters), and the boiling characteristics improved. The 721D bucket is designed to penetrate into the pile easily and transition material to the back of the bucket quickly. D Series buckets fill rapidly and to heaped capacity to move more tons per hour.</p>]]></Nav>
		<Nav ID="3" SubTitle="Single-lever controls" SubPic1="1_3_721Cab05.jpg" SubPic2="NA" SubPic3="NA"><![CDATA[<p>Single-lever controls provide easy operation of the loader, transmission downshift, and return-to-dig and return-to-travel features. An F-N-R quick shuttle switch improves efficiency for fast cycle times. </p>]]></Nav>

		<Nav ID="0" SubTitle="Mid-mount cooling module" SubPic1="2_0_cool1.JPG" SubPic2="2_0_Cool.JPG" SubPic3="NA"><![CDATA[<p>D Series wheel loaders feature a Case-exclusive, cube-shaped mid-mount cooling module that constantly supplies clean ambient air to all coolers, increasing cooling efficiency, extending component life and reducing fluid breakdown.</p> <p>With no stacked coolers, the mid-mount module keeps debris from plugging between coolers and makes Case D Series machines the wheel loaders of choice for any application working in conditions with airborne debris.</p>]]></Nav>
		<Nav ID="1" SubTitle="Electric flip-up hood" SubPic1="2_1_flipuphood.JPG" SubPic2="2_1_Service119.jpg" SubPic3="2_1_Service1_32.jpg"><![CDATA[<p>Electric flip-up hood provides convenient access to ground level maintenance checks, helping make the D Series best in class for ease of maintenance and service.</p>]]></Nav>
		<Nav ID="2" SubTitle="Limited-slip differentials" SubPic1="2_2_limitedslip.jpg" SubPic2="NA" SubPic3="NA"><![CDATA[<p>Limited-slip differentials on both front and rear axles maximize tractive effort and minimize tire wear. This feature transfers power from the wheel that is slipping to the one that is gripping, retaining power when pushing material or crowding a pile in wet or muddy conditions.</p>]]></Nav>
		<Nav ID="3" SubTitle="Ground-level remote drains" SubPic1="2_3_Service101.jpg" SubPic2="2_3_Service102.jpg" SubPic3="NA"><![CDATA[<p>Ground-level remote drains for hydraulic oil, engine oil and coolant make changing fluids quick, easy and environmentally friendly.</p>]]></Nav>

		<Nav ID="0" SubTitle="Angled steps" SubPic1="3_0_angledsteps.jpg" SubPic2="NA" SubPic3="NA"><![CDATA[<p>New angled steps ease entry to and exit from the cab.</p>]]></Nav>
		<Nav ID="1" SubTitle="Tier II-certified Case engines" SubPic1="3_1_Service120.jpg" SubPic2="NA" SubPic3="NA"><![CDATA[<p>The new Case engine in D Series wheel loaders delivers cleaner, more efficient performance thanks to electronic engine controls and charge-air cooling. The new design helps the engines meet the U.S. Environmental Protection Agencyâ€™s Tier II certification for lower emissions.</p><p>Charged air cooling delivers cooled air to the engine intake manifold. Charging of the engine with cooled, denser air results in cleaner combustion and better fuel economy. The Auto Power feature on the 721D is delivered automatically when the engine senses the need, increasing net horsepower from 170 to 184 (127 to 137 kW). A big advantage of having Auto Power is that the machine will match the horsepower to the application automatically.</p>]]></Nav>
		<Nav ID="2" SubTitle="Rear counterweight" SubPic1="3_2_counterwt1.jpg" SubPic2="3_2_counterwt2.jpg" SubPic3="NA"><![CDATA[<p>Dig and lift stability is augmented by an integrated, bumper-style rear counterweight that houses recessed tail lights, stop lights, backup lights and tie-down brackets.</p>]]></Nav>
