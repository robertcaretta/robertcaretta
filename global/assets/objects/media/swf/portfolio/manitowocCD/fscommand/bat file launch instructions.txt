Crane.bat has the command to launch the file.
exitCrane.bat has the code to launch Crane.bat and immediately exit DOS prompt.

on(release) { 
     fscommand("exec","exitCrane.bat")
}


fsCommand("exec", myFile.bat)



// code example in crane files //
// @echo off
// start Rob.ppt
// exit



// --------------------------------------------
ALL files must go into a folder called fscommand. In the flash player use the following code.

// launch application
 fscommand("exec", "exitCrane.bat");

The flash player will automatically go look for the files in the fscommand folder. It does not need to be referenced. Gay.
